            <h4>Overview</h4>
            This site has undergone several iterations over the course of my education. Initially, it was merely thrown
            together in my 2nd year as a means to show my gave development experience. It was very minimal, without
            much visual or UX design consideration. As my knowledge and interests expanded throughout the years, and as the needs of my
            portfolio changed, I changed the design. The site you are using now is the most recent iteration, but definitely not the last.
            </br></br>

            <h4>Challenges</h4>

            <h5>REDESIGNING FOR MORE IN-DEPTH UX STORYTELLING</h5>
            My most recent change to the site has been redesigning portfolio item pages, such as this one, to tell more about my process. I wanted to go more in-depth about the challenges I faced in each project and how I solved them. This decision came from an exploration of how I could further improve my portfolio, as well as feedback from various potential employers and peers.
            </br></br>
            My first step in this process was to look at good examples of successful portfolios and to analyze how they present their ideas. From this, I realized that I wanted to add a wealth of information to my pages, I needed to make them easily scannable and well organized. From here, I broke down the common steps and information I wanted to cover, and made clear sections and subsection headers for each page.
            </br></br>
            I also realized through my discovery process that many other portfolio websites are not afraid of long pages with many static images. Users can choose to scroll at their leisure, and may or may not read all of what is on a page. In the event of skimming, images quickly give a good idea of the nature of a project. Realizing that they are better displayed prominently than hidden in a slideshow, I adjusted the layout of my new site design accordingly.

            <h5>INCLUDING CODING AND DESIGN PROJECTS</h5>
            A problem I faced during the last iteration of my site was an issue of choice: am I a coder, or a designer? My answer is both. But we often hear that your portfolio site should not try to be too many things at once. A good site is focused and curated, with a clear goal in mind. I was faced with a choice or either choosing one route or making a site for both.
            </br></br>
            This led me to implement filtering. For users to see the range of different projects I do, but not be burdened by results they may not be interested in, this was an obvious choice.
            </br></br>
            Technical development was achieved by using Isotope to dynamically hide and adjust content. I considered both checkbox and radio button functonality for the filter, but due to the low number of filter commands (and percieved higher ease of use), I chose radio buttons. Unfortunately, the implemented UI for this is still a work in progress, but the intended design can be shown in mockup below.
            </br></br>

            <h4>Process</h4>

            <h5>DISCOVERY</h5>
            As somewhat touched on in the Challenges section, I always start my discovery process with looking at solid examples of other work. This helps to reveal new types of solutions, and ground my designs in existing conventions. For the initial design, I found that I favored simple websites with a consistent navigation that was always clear and available. A dedicated portfolio page, but with options for filtering multi-disciplinary portfolio items, was something I admired about a few sites I found, so I chose to take those concepts and adapt them to fit the kind of site my work needs. Finally, I discovered that the best portfolio websites often gave a taste of the personality of their author, with a strong landing page or fun "About" section.

            <h5>SKETCHES / WIREFRAMES</h5>
            After research, I sketched the layout options. I experimented with several options for the first page, as well as exploring a long scrolling site versus a multi-paged navigation. I ultimately chose the multi-paged option for easier use, as I believe it does slightly better in terms of user experience than the long scrolling sites.
            </br></br>

            <img src="images/site/it2/sketches.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 10%; width: 80%" />

            <h5>MOCKUPS & DEVELOPMENT</h5>
            I created mockups in Illustrator to further explore what I thought worked best, and to get a better idea of the layout I thought I would choose. Once I had these and had chosen a final direction, I began development.
            </br></br>
            This site was and is developed 100% by me, excluding the tools and libraries used. The technologies used include HTML, CSS, Javascript (for slideshows), JQuery, Isotope (for filtering and animating project links), Boostrap, and Lightbox (for displaying enlarged images).

<!--             USER TESTING
                FEEDBACK FROM VARIOUS EMPLOYERS AND FELLOW DM STUDENTS -->


            <h5>PREVIOUS ITERATIONS</h5>
            This iteration of the site is my third. The original version was thrown together almost thoughtlessly with very little research beforehand. It was plain white and segmented rather unintuitively. The second iteration involved some research, and attempted infusion with my personality, taking a light-hearted and fun take on the visual aspect. The layout was improved signifigantly, but as my design sensibilities grew, I soon realized the visual style looked rather dated. Finally, the most recent iteration came about with the goal of a modern look and feel. I kept the old layout, but focused on the overall style of the site, adding a few useful features such as the portfolio filtering and animations.
            </br></br>

            <img src="images/site/it1/item.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 10%; width: 80%" />


            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            I am currently focusing on implementing the new process-focused layout, in order to better showcase my projects. I am also trying my best to add new projects as they come out, though school often delays this. Once the site's content is fully updated, I will likely next tackle my About page in order to make it more fun and eye-catching.
            </br></br></br></br>


            <!-- The images to the side show the 3 main iterations. Toward the bottom are the wireframes and limited mockups of the original
            design idea, which was never developed. The 2nd iteration came a year later and was the result of extensive research into
            practices of other portfolio websites. I kept the boxes for portfolio items, but added a hover effect to display names
            only when further inspection was desired, decreasing clutter. Nav bar organization was improved, and visual design was
            implemented in a way that the original iteration never had. A side banner was added to provide some branding and personality.
            </br></br>
            The most recent iteration further improves the website. The visual feel of the site has been updated, moving from light and playful
            colors to a more refined and neutral palette with pops of color. The sidebar was removed to further update the look. Typography improved.
            Several new home page designs were considered before settling on the current one.
            The slideshow on the home page was removed and replaced with
            bold text and a playfully colorful background that channels a bit of my personality. Portfolio items were no longer placed on
            separate pages by type, but instead filtered for a more cohesive browsing experience. Mobile responsive
            capabilities were taken into consideration starting with this iteration. -->
