            <h4>Overview</h4>
            This virtual reality forest was an individual class project, inspired by speculative futures and alternate realities. I decided to create an experience in which the residents of Atlanta could go back in time and see what the area was like before modern development. It focuses mainly on education about the original vegetation and wildlife, with a real location component to see the different scenes.
            </br></br>
            There are 2 scenes that users can find - a forest meadow and a creek. The forest meadow is located at the busy intersection of North Avenue and Techwood Drive, to constrast with the peaceful and calming forest ambience. The creek is located at the intersection of Penn and Ponce, which is the historic location of a now non-existant branch of Clear Creek. The 3D tree models can be tapped for information about the forest.
            </br></br>
            The <a href="https://sdykes3.github.io/forestVR/">project website </a>  can be found hosted on GitHub Pages.
            For users who wish to see the scenes without walking to the physical coordinates, I have created a <a href="https://sdykes3.github.io/forestVR/debug.html">debugging version</a> which allows travel via clicking on colored spheres. 
            It works for Android and iPhone (although automatic audio playing may not work on iPhone), in any web browser. This was created using A-Frame, Javascript, and HTML.

            <h4>Challenges</h4>

<!--             CHALLENGES
            SOLUTIONS - STORYTELL HOW I GOT TO THESE SOLUTIONS

            Making something speculative yet related to location
              Solution - Decided on educatonal twist

            Finicky VR development being difficult
              3D tree models importing without texture
              A-Frame errors on load sometimes

              Solution - still ongoing, help from peers -->



            <h5>LOCATION BASED, YET SPECULATIVE</h5>
            The concept was a bit of a challenge at first, due to the requirement of being speculative yet location-based. Being in Atlanta, I wanted a VR experience that could speculate about aspects of the urban environment and make users think. Eventually, I came to the solution of making an educational VR experience. Walking around the city, users are prompted to think about what the city would have looked like before there was a city at all, and in the process they also learn about natural vegetation for the area.

            <h5>VR DEVELOPMENT</h5>
            This was my first virtual reality development project, and I had several development difficulties. The main challenge was with the 3D models I supplemented the scenes with. Ideally, I would have liked my research to lead to a variety of authentic plant species models in the scenes, accompanied by tooltip-like information about them. This would immerse the user in a realistic forest scene.
            </br></br>
            However, the availability of free 3D models was not enough to accomodate all of the specific vegetation I envisioned, so generics were used. Also, little to no shrubs and small plants were available, so I placed mostly trees.
            </br></br>
            Secondly, many of the model textures do not import correctly, depending upon the version of A-Frame I used. I ultimately sacrificed tree model textures for A-Frames ability to work with the pop-up informative text, a more valued component of the experience. This sacrifice allows the functional vision of the project to shine through, but I am still seeking a solution to the unsightly lack of texture for the models. I have still kept the models, though. This is because they are the buttons that toggle their cooresponding information visibility, allowing users to turn the text off and enjoy the forest scenery when desired.
            </br></br>






            <h4>Process</h4>



            <h5>CONCEPT</h5>
            The inspiration for my concept came from walking around the city and imagining the peaceful ambience that must have previously existed here before urban development. I wanted to capture the authenticity of the original Piedmont forest and allow users to be transported there.
            </br></br>
            The original concept for the design was to populate the location-based scenes with accurate 3D models of different tree species, as well as immersive sound and educational text about what the user is seeing. Various scenes with different content would be placed around the city, allowing users to walk to particular GPS coordinates in order to discover them. A default scene is shown when outside of these special locations, providing background and context for the experience as well as live updating feedback on your distance from each special scene.
            </br></br>

            <img src="images/vrforest/unity_good.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 10%; width: 80%" /> </a>

            <h5>DISCOVERY</h5>
            I began with extensive research into the natural vegetation and geography of the region. The initial research involved discovering the species of plant and wildlife in Georgia, as well as their relative populations and which modern species are actually invasive. This was accomplished through general online research as well as investigation of the Fernbank Forest, which is a local 65-acre section of original forest growth in Atlanta.
            </br></br>
            I used this information to inform the types of scenes I would make and to select the educational information to put in them. I also began to select which plant species I wanted to display, but did not fully pursue this due to technical difficulties with acquiring the models

            <h5>DEVELOPMENT</h5>
            This VR experience was developed using A-Frame, Javascript, and HTML. It is intended to be used in a mobile web browser, but can also be paired with VR devices such as Google Cardboard. It works with mobile version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, and is hosted on Github Pages currently.
            </br></br>
            Three scenes exist: default context/navigation, a forest, and a creek. These are hidden and shown based on GPS information from the mobile device. When a scene is activated, ambient looping sound is triggered with Javascript. An A-Frame cursor is present, and when the user aims it at a 3D model and taps, a piece of informative text's visibility is toggled.
            </br></br>
            In an earlier version, I used Unity in conjunction with A-Frame to place the models (which were able to be textured at the time). However, this older version of A-Frame was not compatibile with text, so I changed to the newer version which I believe causes the textureless model issue.


            <h5>USER TESTING</h5>
            I tested the project with a handful of users, as well as testing it for myself during development. Feedback was generally favorable, and I improved instruction and context for the experience based on what was said. Users generally thought that it was "very cool" and represented "something [they] had never really thought about before." Basing it in fact went over very well, and one user said she found it be "very peaceful."
            </br></br>
            Unfortunately, I also found that some technical problems limit the user experience. As previously mentioned, the textureless models were found to break immersion. Additionally, cursor feedback when hovering over the trees (to signal that they can be tapped for information) is currently not present, due to the "fuse" setting on the cursor. Turning fuse to true would result in a nice animation but no ambient sound, and vise verse, ultimately resulting in abandonment of the hover animation in favor of audio. However, I found that most users could have benefited from this type of cue.

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            Given more time, I would really have liked to further address some of the technical issues. I am still currently investigating how to get textured tree models into the scenes and this is probably my biggest concern right now. This is followed by the lack of a cursor animation over models, so users can know that they should try tapping.
            </br></br>
            Providing better instructions, giving directional feedback on the locations, and possibly finding the originally intended plant species models would also be other good improvements.
            </br></br>
            Overall, however, this was a very fun project. I enjoyed the research quite a bit, and loved getting to develop a virtual reality experience. This is something that I am very glad to have developed, and is perhaps the first of many VR / MR projects that I will work on.
