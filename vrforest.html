            <h4>Overview</h4>
            This virtual reality forest was an individual class project, inspired by speculative futures and alternate realities. I decided to create an experience in which the residents of Atlanta could go back in time and see what the area was like before modern development. It focuses mainly on education about the original vegetation and wildlife, with a real location component to see the different scenes.
            </br></br>
            There are 2 scenes that users can find - a forest meadow and a creek. The forest meadow is located at the busy intersection of North Avenue and Techwood Drive, to constrast with the peaceful and calming forest ambience. The creek is located at the intersection of Penn and Ponce, which is the historic location of a now non-existant branch of Clear Creek. The 3D tree models can be tapped for information about the forest.
            </br></br>
            The project can be found <a href="https://sdykes3.github.io/forestVR/">here.</a> 
            For users who wish to see the scenes without walking to the physical coordinates, I have created a <a href="https://sdykes3.github.io/forestVR/debug.html">debugging version</a> which allows travel via clicking on colored spheres. 
            It works for Android and iPhone (although automatic audio playing may not work on iPhone), in any web browser. This was created using A-Frame, Javascript, and HTML.

            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            CHALLENGES

            Making something speculative yet related to location
              Decided on educatonal twist

            Finicky VR development being difficult
              3D tree models importing without texture
              A-Frame errors on load sometimes


            SOLUTIONS - STORYTELL HOW I GOT TO THESE SOLUTIONS
            
            </br></br>

            <h4>Process</h4>

            DISCOVERY - USER CENTERED RESEARCH
              FERNBANK FOREST

            PROTOTYPING
            USER TESTING
              Mitch



            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            The inspiration for my concept came from walking around the city and imagining the peaceful ambience that must have previously existed here before. To recapture the authenticity of the original Piedmont forest, I began extensive research into the natural vegetation and geography of the region.
            </br></br>
            This research involved discovering the species of plant and wildlife here, as well as their relative populations and which modern species are actually invasive. This was accomplished through general internet research as well as investigation of the Fernbank Forest, which is a 65-acre section of original forest growth in Atlanta.
            </br></br>

            <h4>Design</h4>
            Original intern of the design was to populate the location-based scenes with accurate 3D models of different tree species, as well as immersive sound and informative text about what the user is seeing. Various scenes with different content would be placed around the city, allowing users to walk to particular GPS coordinates in order to discover them. A default scene is shown when outside of these special locations, providing background and context for the experience as well as live updating feedback on your distance from each special scene.
            </br></br>
                        <img src="images/vrforest/unity_good.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 10%; width: 80%" /> </a>

                </br></br>        
            I encountered various difficulties throughout development that limited my original vision, though I believe that the majority of the concept still came through.
            </br></br>
            The most notable shortcoming is likely the colorless models. I briefly achieved colored tree models by placing them with Unity and exporting the scene to A-Frame, but had to switch back to manual A-Frame models due to version constraints which would have made the informative text impossible. Thus, the final product has textureless models.
            </br></br>
            Additionally, due to technical and financial limitations of the free 3D models I found online, I was not able to provide accurate populations of specific tree species in the scenes. Not all models worked well with the Unity version of the project, and they worked even less with the final version. I switched to generic tree types in order to make development easier and free of cost.
            </br></br>
            Finally, some technical problems limit the user experience. I was unable to get directional feedback (north, south, east, west) working in the default navigation scene, which is less than ideal. Additionally, cursor feedback when hovering over the trees (to signal that they can be tapped for information) is currently not present, due to the "fuse" setting on the cursor. Turning fuse to true would result in a nice animation but no ambient sound, and vise verse, ultimately resulting in abandonment of the hover animation in favor of audio.

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            Given more time, there are a number of issues I would like to address. I am still currently investigating how to get textured tree models into the scenes and this is probably my biggest concern right now, as it breaks immersion.
            </br></br>
            There are several user experience improvements that could be made as well, such as providing better instructions and giving directional feedback on the locations. Cursor feedback when hovering over trees is something I would also very much like to add, since many users will not think to tap on them and will miss the instructional text in the default scene.
            </br></br>
            Overall, this was a very fun project. I enjoyed the research quite a bit, and loved getting to develop a virtual reality experience. This is something that I will continue to work on, and is perhaps the first of many VR / AR / MR projects that I will work on.
