            <h4>Overview</h4>
            This app design is part of my international coursework in Copenhagen, Denmark, for a class focusing on designing context-aware applications to help Copehnagen become the first carbon-neutral capital by 2025. This app design utilizes the Hitachi smart city sensor network, in order to gather information about the environment and adjust the app's behavior accordingly. This design project was a group effort in collboration with Kristine Carlsen and Thørbjorn Hagelskær.

            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            The process began with brainstorming about various ways in which we could help Copenhagen become more carbon-neutral. We eventually settled on an app that would, instead of promting users to reduce their own emissions, place emphasis on rewarding those who are already taking steps. By promoting eco-friendly businesses, the app would make it a more profitable business model and stimulate conversation. It is important to note that the cultural environment of Copenhagen makes this possible, where as in other places such an app might not succeed due to differing cultural values.
            </br></br>
            A survey was sent to gather information about the kinds of businesses that Copenhagen residents use, know are eco-friendly, and would like to find more eco-friendly options for. We also conducted in-person interviews in the city. After analyzing the data, we began to sketch and mockup some ideas. A prototype was created from the mockups, and tested with users. Using this feedback, we iterated on the design to make it more understandable.
            </br></br>

            <h4>Design</h4>
            The app begins at the home page, where GPS data is utilized to show businesses near the user's current location. Leaves indicate how environmentally friendly the shop is, as well as a description about how they are taking steps to be green. Users may also search by category, such as shops, bars, and restuarants, and view these results on a map that is centered on their current location.
            </br></br>
            An optional in-app route planner is available. This was inspired by the thought that finding a carbon-neutral business to support is less eco-friendly overall if you travel there by car, and those who walk or ride bikes may wish to utilize the sensor data and travel via a "greener" route that has less traffic and pollution. Therefore, the route planner has an option for the Greenest route as well as the default Shortest route.
            </br></br>
            We also chose to include a social experience in the app, in order to increase attention for this cause and the reward patronage to environmental businesses. This is accessible by MyPage, which is a feed that indicates which of your friends have most recently checked in at stores, as well as how many times. The check in is automatic (but may be disabled in Settings), utilizing the Hitachi sensors placed in businesses and the context-aware capabilities of the app.

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            This was a rewarding and fun design challenge. Having the opportunity to consider the user needs of a different culture was a great experience, and designing for a cause that I care about was fantastic. This was the most in-depth data collection I had engaged in up to this point, and I found that to greatly increase my confidence in the design decisions our group made. I am very proud of the final design we came to, and would love if an app like this existed where I live now.
