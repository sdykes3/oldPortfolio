            <h4>Overview</h4>
            This a is mobile app design for Georgia Tech's course management site. T-Square is used by students to view and submit homework assignments, check grades, see recent announcements, find lecture materials, and more. However, it is slow and difficult to access on your phone, and many students complain of the very dated and unintuitive interface.

            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            My process began with discovering and collecting accounts from other students about how they interact with T-Square. I went through T-Square to explore its features, then surveyed fellow Georiga Tech students about which features they use most and where they find common pain points to be. Leveraging this, I decided that my goal should not to be cram all of T-Square, which is a large and complex application, into a single app. Instead, I chose to design for relieving the problems associated with accessing the most frequently used features on the go.
            </br></br>

            <h4>Design</h4>
            The design process began by compiling the data collected in the discovery phase. I ranked the features according what is used most often, and put them in a higher priority in my sketches. I explored desirable interactions and different layout options. After sketching and wireframing to choose the layout and heirarchy of information, I began to build a site map using Balsamiq. Next I did a greyscale mockup in Illustrator, to ensure the chosen colors have appropriately contrasting values and the design can stand on its own without relying purely on decorative effects. Finally, I applied color to the design.
            </br></br>
            I chose to color code classes to help keep high work loads easily distinguishable. This is a feature that I found desirable in CourseOff, a scheduling tool, and decided to extend it to here since it would also likely help with navigation. I decided to do an overall calendar on the home page rather than on indivudal course pages, so students do not have to check each course page to know if they need to do homework that night. For indivudal pages, I chose to put newly updated information at the top in a special feed, in order to distinguish it from older messages.

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            I feel that this was a good exercise in my design process skills, though I did not take the concept into and stage of development, primarily due to the unliklihood of Georgia Tech's cooperation. 
            
            If I could do anything differently in hindsight, I would likely have done more research. In addition to interviewing and surveying students, asking the opinion of faculty or TAs could have provided extra insights to incorporate into the final design.

      This app is based heavily on principles of material design, as it includes common components such as cards and
      "paper" sheets upon which elements are placed. The color palette and typography are also drawn from material design.
