            <h4>Overview</h4>
            This app design is part of my Spring 2016 international coursework in Copenhagen, Denmark, for a class focusing on designing context-aware applications to help Copehnagen become the first carbon-neutral capital by 2025. This app design utilizes the Hitachi smart city sensor network, in order to gather information about the environment and adjust the app's behavior accordingly. This design project was a group effort in collboration with Kristine Carlsen and Thørbjorn Hagelskær, Danish students at IT University of Copenhagen.

            <h4>Challenges</h4>

            <h5>DESIGNING FOR A FOREIGN CITY AND CULTURE</h5>

            My largest challenge for this project was practicing design for a foreign audience. Assumptions I had about how certain features may work were not necessarily true in Denmark, and even if they were, that did not mean they were necessarily true for Copenhagen. I had to be mindful and fact-check my designs harder than ever before by consulting more users and collaborating with my Danish group members at each step in the process.

            Additionally, I relied on my group mates for translation. We worked together in English, collaborating on designs and phrasing of surveys and interview questions. They then translated and conducted interviews in Danish, a decision made for the comfort of the participants to encourage easy information sharing, then translated responses back into English for our group analysis process.

         <!--    </br></br>
            Beyond that, it was also a challenge to meet the course requirements of using the city sensor network (which was hypothetical and to be developed in the future). Our design decisions were at times very closely tied to course feedback which we did not necessarily agree with from a user experience perspective, but was necessary to succeed in the course. -->
<!-- 
            One such example of this is the filtering mechanism for suggested businesses. In our final design, the least frequently visited locations are shown first to promote their much needed business. -->


            <h5>ORGANIC IS NOT NECESSARILY CARBON-NEUTRAL</h5>

            The most significant hurdle we faced was an early conceptual mistake, which cost us a fair amount of time and effort. Our intial survey and qualitative street interviews mixed healthy, organic, and green businesses together. In reality, however, these are not all carbon-neutral. For example, organic products are often very carbon producing due to extra efforts to keep them organic and long shipping distances.
            </br></br>
            This was rectified in our second round of user surveys and interviews, and many of the questions from the first round were able to be used still. However, this problem still represented a significant point in Green Guide's conceptual history, and resulting in the need to redouble our efforts to ensure that users will understand the difference between organic, eco-friendly, and carbon-neutral in the final design. This was mainly achieved through interviews with prospective businesses to be featured on the app, and then highlighting in their description how they are making an effort to help the environment. We also touched on this with the Category menu and cooresponding badges.

            </br></br>

                2 - simple and straightforward, GPS within is a big plus, liked that friends are reviewing stores instead of complete strangers (so no turning it into Yelp), also said Favorites should turn into something more personal and friend related, wanted price info to be in details of shop (wants somewhat hidden to not turn people away) -->


            <h5>CONCEPT</h5>
            The process began with brainstorming about various ways in which we could help Copenhagen become more carbon-neutral. We eventually settled on an app that, instead of prompting users to reduce their own emissions, would place emphasis on rewarding those who are already taking steps. By promoting eco-friendly businesses, the app would make it a more profitable business model and stimulate conversation. It is important to note that the cultural environmentality of Copenhagen makes this viable, where as in other places such an app might not succeed due to differing cultural values.

            <h5>DISCOVERY</h5>
            A survey was sent to gather information about the kinds of businesses that Copenhagen residents use, know are eco-friendly, and would like to find more eco-friendly options for. The first survey included organic options mixed in with carbon-neutral, and had to be reworded and redone. The second survey was shared on Facebook by all group members and some of their family members, and got 97 unique responses from various areas of Copenhagen.
            </br></br>
            We also conducted in-person qualitative interviews in the city. 2 rounds of interviews were done, with strangers and with prospective users that we knew but were not ITU students. The on-street interviews were early, during the organic-concept phase, but much of their information was still usable. The in-depth potential user interviews were later, and informed by the results of both surveys and some in-class feedback of our early iterations. This section does not include the user testing of the prototype, which was conducted later with our mostly finished design.

            <img class="pic" src="images/green-guide/slide_survey0.png" />


            <h5>SKETCHES / MOCKUPS</h5>
            After the first survey, we began to decide features and use-cases of the app, followed by sketching. We updated our designs after recieving course feedback, and redirected our design to make the distinction between organic and carbon-neutral more clear to users.
            </br></br>
            We had started Green Guide in a scavenger-hunt direction, where the app would give a "Discovery List" each month of places to visit and earn points. After initial user interview feedback, however, we removed that and began to focus more heavily on social aspects of the app. This lead to a "Favorites" page being a place to see where you and your friends have visited most, as a type of social recommendation feature.
            </br></br>
            We began making mockups as soon as we felt we had a cohesive app detailed out, so that we could more clearly see where to focus next and begin prototyping and user testing for the next iterations.

            <img class="pic" src="images/green-guide/slide_sketch.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 15%; width: 70%" />


            <h5>PROTOTYPING & USER TESTING</h5>
            An InVision prototype was created from the mockups and tested with 2 potential users, who were different from the interviewees.
            </br></br>
            One of the most significant changes due to feedback was changing "Favorites" to "My Page", in order to make it "more personal and social" and to "connect it to social media." Both users suggested changes in this direction. One went so far as to say that he wanted to see what his friends were doing on that app because he "value[s] that more than reviews from complete strangers."
            </br></br>
            Both users said they liked the simple and straight-forward nature of the app, and could see themselves using it. One user also affirmed that he liked having in-app navigation rather than using a separate application. This was a large component of our earlier surveys, and was good to have a final confirmation of.

           <h5>FINAL FUNCTIONALITY</h5>
            The app begins at the home page, where GPS data is utilized to show businesses near the user's current location. Leaves indicate how environmentally friendly the shop is, as well as a description about how they are taking steps to be green. Users may also search by category, such as shops, bars, and restuarants, and view these results on a map that is centered on their current location.
            </br></br>
            An optional in-app route planner is available. This was inspired by the thought that finding a carbon-neutral business to support is less eco-friendly overall if you travel there by car, and those who walk or ride bikes may wish to utilize the sensor data and travel via a "greener" route that has less traffic and pollution. Therefore, the route planner has an option for the Greenest route as well as the default Shortest route.
            </br></br>
            We also chose to include a social experience in the app, in order to increase attention for this cause and the reward patronage to environmental businesses. This is accessible by MyPage, which is a feed that indicates which of your friends have most recently checked in at stores, as well as how many times. The check in is automatic (but may be disabled in Settings), utilizing the Hitachi sensors placed in businesses and the context-aware capabilities of the app.

            </br></br>


            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            This was a rewarding and fun design challenge. Having the opportunity to consider the user needs of a different culture was a great experience, and designing for a cause that I care about was fantastic. This was the most in-depth data collection I had engaged in up to this point, and I found that to greatly increase my confidence in the design decisions our group made. I am very proud of the final design we came to, and would love if an app like this existed and were viable where I live now.
